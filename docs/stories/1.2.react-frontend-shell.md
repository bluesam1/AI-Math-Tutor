# Story 1.2: React Frontend Shell with Side-by-Side Layout

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** student,
**I want** to see a clean interface with a side-by-side layout (problem on left, chat on right),
**so that** I can reference the problem while engaging in dialogue.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: A React application is initialized with TypeScript (using `.tsx` extensions for React components), functional components and React Hooks for state management, using the latest stable React version. All code must be written in TypeScript (no raw JavaScript).

2: Tailwind CSS v4.1.16 is installed and configured with appropriate Tailwind configuration for the project.

3: The main interface displays a side-by-side layout with two primary panels: left panel for problem display, right panel for chat conversation (currently empty).

4: The layout is responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers (responsive breakpoints implemented with Tailwind CSS).

5: The interface uses age-appropriate styling appropriate for 6th grade students (clean, colorful but not overwhelming, friendly visual elements).

6: The left panel has a header or title area indicating "Problem" or similar, with space for displaying the problem statement.

7: The right panel has a header or title area indicating "Chat" or similar, with space for displaying conversation messages.

8: The layout maintains proper spacing and visual hierarchy using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 1.1: Foundation & Project Setup**

- Monorepo structure is established with apps/web for frontend
- Vite is configured as build tool
- TypeScript is configured for frontend
- Canary page is deployed and working

### Project Structure

The frontend application structure follows the monorepo pattern: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Technology Stack Requirements

**Frontend Dependencies:**

- React: ^18.2.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]
- react-dom: ^18.2.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]
- TypeScript: ^5.3.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]
- Tailwind CSS: v4.1.16 (exact version required) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]
- Vite: ^5.0.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]
- @vitejs/plugin-react: ^4.2.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]
- @types/react: ^18.2.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]
- @types/react-dom: ^18.2.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]

**State Management:**

- React Hooks (useState, useContext) - built-in, no additional dependencies [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

### Coding Standards

**Critical Rules:**

- TypeScript Only: All code must be TypeScript (no raw JavaScript) - `.tsx` for React components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Functional Components: Use functional components with React Hooks (no class components)
- Component Naming: PascalCase for components (e.g., `Layout.tsx`, `ProblemPanel.tsx`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming Conventions]

**Styling Guidelines:**

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling
- No inline styles or CSS modules (use Tailwind classes)
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind spacing scale
- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) for responsive design

### File Locations

**Component Files:**

- `apps/web/src/components/Layout.tsx` - Main layout component
- `apps/web/src/components/ProblemPanel.tsx` - Left panel component
- `apps/web/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` - Right panel component

**Style Files:**

- `apps/web/src/styles/globals.css` - Global styles and Tailwind directives
- `apps/web/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS v4.1.16 configuration

**Type Files:**

- `apps/web/src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript type definitions for components

**Main Files:**

- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Main app component using Layout
- `apps/web/src/main.tsx` - React entry point

### Layout Design

**Side-by-Side Layout Structure:**

- Left Panel (Problem Panel): 50% width on desktop, full width on mobile
- Right Panel (Chat Panel): 50% width on desktop, full width on mobile
- Both panels have headers with titles
- Layout uses flexbox or CSS Grid for responsive behavior

**Responsive Breakpoints:**

- Mobile (< 768px): Stack vertically, panels full width
- Tablet (768px - 1024px): Side-by-side with adjusted widths
- Desktop (> 1024px): Full side-by-side layout

**Age-Appropriate Styling:**

- Color scheme: Friendly, approachable colors (blues, greens, soft purples)
- Typography: Clear, readable fonts appropriate for 6th grade
- Visual elements: Clean, uncluttered, with subtle friendly elements
- Spacing: Generous spacing for readability

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:**

- Manual visual testing for layout and responsive behavior
- Browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Device testing on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- TypeScript compilation verification

**Test File Locations:**

- Frontend tests: `apps/web/tests/` (to be created in later stories)
- Component tests: `apps/web/tests/components/` (to be created in later stories)

**Testing Requirements:**

- No unit tests required for this story (layout is primarily visual)
- Manual verification of responsive behavior
- Browser compatibility testing
- TypeScript compilation verification

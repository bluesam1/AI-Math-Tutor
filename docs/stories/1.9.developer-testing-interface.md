# Story 1.9: Developer Testing Interface

## Status

Complete

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a streamlined testing interface that allows me to easily test different problem types, scenarios, and edge cases,
**so that** I can efficiently validate system behavior and ensure Socratic compliance across all problem types.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: A developer testing interface is accessible only in development environment (hidden in production builds), accessible via `NODE_ENV=development` or a development mode flag.

2: The testing interface provides a test problem library with pre-configured test problems organized by problem type (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, word problems, multi-step), with at least 10 test problems per problem type (50+ total scenarios).

3: Developers can load test problems with one click from the test problem library, automatically populating the problem input and starting a test session.

4: The testing interface includes a scenario testing panel that allows developers to test specific scenarios including:

- Answer detection validation (direct answers, implicit answers)
- Progressive help escalation (testing help escalation after stuck turns)
- Context management (testing conversation coherence across 10+ messages)
- Error handling scenarios (Vision API failures, LLM API failures, rate limits)

5: Real-time testing indicators display during testing, showing:

- Answer detection status (keyword detection, LLM validation results)
- Socratic compliance validation (pass/fail status)
- Context management status (session state, message history)
- Help escalation level (current help level, escalation triggers)

6: The testing interface provides quick access to edge case scenarios including:

- Direct answer detection patterns ("the answer is", "equals", numeric results)
- Implicit answer detection patterns (subtle answer phrasings)
- Boundary conditions (empty inputs, invalid problems, session expiration)
- Error scenarios (API failures, network errors, timeout errors)

7: A test results dashboard displays visual summary of test results including:

- Pass/fail status for each test scenario
- Socratic compliance percentage (100% required)
- Answer detection accuracy (keyword detection rate, LLM validation rate)
- Context management validation (message retention, session state)

8: The testing interface supports batch testing, allowing developers to run multiple test scenarios in sequence or parallel, with automated test execution and results reporting.

9: Test utilities and fixtures are provided programmatically, enabling developers to write automated tests for different problem types, answer detection scenarios, and edge cases.

10: The testing interface is designed for efficiency, allowing developers to run comprehensive test suites for all problem types in under 5 minutes.

11: The testing interface is hidden in production builds and cannot be accessed by end users, ensuring security and privacy.

12: The testing interface integrates with the existing test suite, allowing developers to run both manual and automated tests from the same interface.

# Story 3.14: Visual Polish & Branding

## Status

Pending

## Story

**As a** student,
**I want** the application to have polished visual effects, smooth animations, and complete logo branding,
**so that** the interface feels modern, sleek, and professionally designed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: Gradients are implemented throughout the application:
- Primary gradient: Sky blue to lighter blue (inspired by logo's circular background)
- Accent gradient: Lime green to lighter green
- Background gradient: Subtle sky blue to white
- Button gradients for depth (where appropriate)

2: Colored shadows are implemented:
- Primary blue shadows for primary elements
- Lime green shadows for success/accent elements
- Subtle depth shadows for cards

3: Smooth animations are implemented:
- Color transitions on hover (buttons, links)
- Subtle scale animations on buttons
- Loading animations use brand colors
- Celebration animations with confetti in brand colors

4: Micro-interactions are polished:
- Button hover states with smooth color transitions
- Input focus states with blue ring animation
- Success feedback with green flash animation
- Smooth page transitions

5: Logo is integrated in all appropriate locations:
- Header/navigation area (if exists)
- Empty state (centered, prominent)
- Loading states (subtle logo animation)
- Favicon (logo as favicon)

6: Logo-inspired elements are added:
- Calculator icon in lime green for active/problem areas
- Math symbols in lime green (like logo's calculator)
- Subtle decorative elements (optional, not distracting)

7: Responsive design is maintained:
- Colors maintain contrast on mobile
- Logo sizing is responsive
- Gradients are optimized for mobile
- Touch targets remain accessible (44px minimum)

8: Accessibility is verified:
- All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards
- Focus states are visible and clear
- Keyboard navigation works properly
- Screen reader compatibility maintained

9: Cross-browser compatibility is verified:
- Gradients render properly in all browsers
- Animations work smoothly
- Colors display correctly
- No visual regressions

10: Final polish is complete:
- Consistent spacing throughout
- Unified design language
- Professional appearance
- Engaging for 6th grade students

# Story 1.4: Text Input for Math Problems

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** student,
**I want** to input math problems by typing or pasting text into the interface,
**so that** I can submit problems for the tutor to help me solve.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: A text input field is displayed in the left panel (or above the side-by-side layout) with a clear label indicating "Enter Math Problem" or similar.

2: Students can type or paste problem statements into the text input field.

3: A "Submit" or "Start" button is available next to the input field to submit the problem.

4: When a problem is submitted, the text input is validated to ensure it contains text (not empty).

5: The submitted problem is displayed in the left panel (problem display area) after submission.

6: The text input field is cleared after successful submission, ready for a new problem (if needed).

7: Error handling is implemented for invalid input (empty input shows appropriate error message).

8: The input field is accessible via keyboard navigation and supports standard input behaviors (select, copy, paste).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 1.2: React Frontend Shell**

- Side-by-side layout is established with ProblemPanel and ChatPanel
- Tailwind CSS v4.1.16 is configured
- Layout is responsive and age-appropriate styling is applied

**Story 1.3: Backend API Structure**

- Backend API is ready to receive problem submissions (future stories)
- Health check endpoint is working

### Project Structure

The text input functionality integrates with the existing frontend structure:

```
apps/web/src/
├── components/
│   ├── Layout.tsx              # Main layout (uses ProblemInput)
│   ├── ProblemPanel.tsx        # Left panel (displays problem)
│   ├── ProblemInput.tsx        # NEW: Text input component
│   └── ChatPanel.tsx           # Right panel (future use)
├── types/
│   └── problem.ts              # NEW: Problem type definitions
└── App.tsx                     # Main app component
```

### Technology Stack Requirements

**Frontend Dependencies:**

- React: ^18.2.0 (already installed) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]
- React Hooks: useState (built-in)
- Tailwind CSS: v4.1.16 (already installed) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Frontend Dependencies]

**No additional dependencies required** - using built-in React features and Tailwind CSS.

### Coding Standards

**Critical Rules:**

- TypeScript Only: All code must be TypeScript - `.tsx` for React components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Functional Components: Use functional components with React Hooks [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Component Naming: PascalCase for components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming Conventions]

**State Management:**

- Use React useState hook for local component state
- No global state management needed for this story (simple local state)

### File Locations

**Component Files:**

- `apps/web/src/components/ProblemInput.tsx` - Text input component (NEW)
- `apps/web/src/components/ProblemPanel.tsx` - Updated to display problem

**Type Files:**

- `apps/web/src/types/problem.ts` - Problem type definitions (NEW)

### UI/UX Design

**Input Field Design:**

- Clear label: "Enter Math Problem" or "What math problem would you like help with?"
- Large, readable input field (appropriate for 6th grade)
- Placeholder text: "Type or paste your math problem here..."
- Age-appropriate styling (friendly, approachable)

**Submit Button:**

- Clear label: "Submit" or "Start"
- Prominent, easy-to-click button
- Loading state for future API integration
- Disabled state when input is empty

**Error Messages:**

- Friendly, age-appropriate error messages
- Example: "Please enter a math problem before submitting"
- Visible but not alarming
- Clear indication of what needs to be fixed

**Problem Display:**

- Clear typography for problem statement
- Proper spacing and readability
- Text wrapping for long problems
- Visual distinction from input area

### State Management

**Component State:**

- `problemText` - Current problem text (string)
- `error` - Error message (string | null)
- `isSubmitting` - Submission state (boolean, for future use)

**State Flow:**

1. User types/pastes problem → updates `problemText`
2. User clicks Submit → validates input
3. If valid → updates problem display, clears input
4. If invalid → shows error message

### Accessibility

**Accessibility Requirements:**

- ARIA labels for input field
- ARIA attributes for error messages
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**

- Enter key: Submit problem (when input is focused)
- Escape key: Clear input (optional)
- Tab: Navigate between input and button

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:**

- Manual testing for input functionality
- Manual testing for validation
- Manual testing for keyboard navigation
- Browser testing on different devices
- TypeScript compilation verification

**Test Scenarios:**

1. Type problem and submit → should display in panel
2. Paste problem and submit → should display in panel
3. Submit empty input → should show error
4. Submit valid problem → should clear input
5. Test keyboard navigation
6. Test responsive behavior

**Test File Locations:**

- Component tests: `apps/web/tests/components/ProblemInput.test.tsx` (to be created in later stories)

### Integration Points

**Current Story:**

- Frontend-only implementation
- No backend API calls yet
- Problem state managed locally

**Future Stories:**

- Story 1.7: Problem validation will call backend API
- Story 1.8: Problem display will be enhanced with problem type
- Future epics: Problem submission will trigger chat dialogue

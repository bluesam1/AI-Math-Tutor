## Status

Pending

## Story

**As a** student,
**I want** the interface to look friendly and engaging for my age group,
**so that** I feel comfortable using the tutor.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: The interface uses Tailwind CSS v4.1.16 for styling, with appropriate Tailwind configuration and design tokens.

2: The styling is age-appropriate for 6th grade students (ages 11-12), using:

- Colorful but not overwhelming color palette
- Friendly visual elements (emojis, icons, simple animations)
- Clear typography that is readable for the age group
- Appropriate spacing and visual hierarchy

3: The styling maintains a clean, educational aesthetic:

- Minimalist core with plenty of white space
- Focus on mathematical content (equations, formulas)
- Clear visual hierarchy emphasizing problem and dialogue

4: The styling is consistent throughout the interface:

- Consistent color scheme across components
- Consistent typography and spacing
- Consistent interactive element styling (buttons, inputs, etc.)

5: The styling uses Tailwind CSS utility classes effectively, maintaining design consistency and avoiding custom CSS where possible.

6: The styling is responsive and works effectively across all device types (desktop, tablet, mobile).

7: The styling is accessible, meeting WCAG AA standards for color contrast and accessibility.

8: The styling is optimized for performance, ensuring fast loading and smooth interactions.

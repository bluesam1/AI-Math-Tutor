# Story 3.1: LaTeX/KaTeX Math Rendering Integration

## Status

Completed

## Story

**As a** student,
**I want** to see mathematical equations and formulas rendered properly in problems and responses,
**so that** I can read and understand mathematical notation clearly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: LaTeX/KaTeX library is installed and configured in the React frontend application.

2: The math rendering library automatically detects LaTeX/KaTeX syntax in problem statements and dialogue responses.

3: Mathematical equations and formulas are rendered with proper formatting, including:

- Fractions, exponents, square roots
- Variables, constants, operators
- Algebraic expressions, equations
- Geometric notation (angles, shapes, measurements)

4: The math rendering works in both the problem display component (left panel) and chat conversation component (right panel).

5: The rendering is responsive and works effectively on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.

6: The rendering handles inline math expressions (e.g., `$x + 5 = 10$`) and block math expressions (e.g., `$$\frac{a}{b} = c$$`).

7: The rendering is accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers (appropriate ARIA labels for mathematical content).

8: The math rendering library is optimized for performance, ensuring smooth rendering without noticeable delays.

## Dependencies

- Story 1.8: Problem Display Component (ProblemPanel component exists)
- Story 2.7: Chat UI Component (ChatPanel component exists)

## Required By

- Story 3.5: Comprehensive Testing Across All 5 Problem Types (math rendering needs to be tested)

## Notes

- KaTeX is recommended over MathJax for better performance and smaller bundle size
- Consider using `react-katex` for easier React integration, or `katex` with custom React wrapper
- Math rendering should handle both inline (`$...$`) and block (`$$...$$`) expressions
- Ensure math expressions are accessible for screen readers (ARIA labels, alternative text)
- Performance optimization may be needed for pages with many math expressions
- Consider caching rendered math expressions to improve performance

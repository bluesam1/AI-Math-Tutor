# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for AI Math Tutor, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** N/A - Greenfield project

The PRD specifies a monorepo structure combining frontend and backend code in a single repository. No existing starter template or codebase is mentioned. This is a greenfield project that will be built from scratch using modern fullstack patterns.

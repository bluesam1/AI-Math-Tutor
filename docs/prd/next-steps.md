# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Create a UX design system and detailed UI specifications for the AI Math Tutor application based on this PRD. Focus on the target age group (6th grade students, ages 11-12), ensuring the interface is age-appropriate, engaging, and maintains educational effectiveness. Design the side-by-side layout (problem left, chat right), visual feedback elements, and responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile devices. Use Tailwind CSS v4.1.16 for styling, ensuring WCAG AA accessibility compliance.

### Architect Prompt

Design the system architecture for the AI Math Tutor application based on this PRD. Create detailed architecture diagrams, component specifications, API contracts, and database schemas (if needed). Focus on the serverless architecture with AWS Lambda functions, React frontend, session management, Vision API integration, LLM integration with answer detection guardrails, and context management. Ensure the architecture supports all functional and non-functional requirements, including scalability, security, and performance requirements.
